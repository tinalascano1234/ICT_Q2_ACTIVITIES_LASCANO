<div class="paragraphs">
<p class="Para1">Baby love, I think I've been a little too kind <br>
Didn't notice you walking all over my peace of mind<br>
In the shoes I gave you as a present<br>
Puttin' someone first only works when you're in their top five<br>
And by the way, I'm going out tonight</p>

<p class="Para2">Best believe I'm still bejeweled<br>
When I walk in the room<br>
I can still make the whole place shimmer<br>
And when I meet the band<br>
They ask, "Do you have a man?"<br>
I can still say, "I don't remember"<br>
Familiarity breeds contempt<br>
Don't put me in the basement<br>
When I want the penthouse of your heart<br>
Diamonds in my eyes<br>
I polish up real, I polish up real nice</p>

<p class="Para3">Baby boy, I think I've been too good of a girl (too good of a girl)<br>
Did all the extra credit, then got graded on a curve<br>
I think it's time to teach some lessons<br>
I made you my world (huh), have you heard? (Huh)<br>
I can reclaim the land<br>
And I miss you (I miss you)<br>
But I miss sparkling (ah, hey)</p>

<p class="Para4">Best believe I'm still bejeweled<br>
When I walk in the room<br>
I can still make the whole place shimmer<br>
And when I meet the band<br>
They ask, "Do you have a man?"<br>
I can still say, "I don't remember"<br>
Familiarity breeds contempt<br>
Don't put me in the basement<br>
When I want the penthouse of your heart<br>
Diamonds in my eyes<br>
I polish up real, I polish up real nice
</p>

<p class="para5">Sapphire tears on my face<br>
Sadness became my whole sky<br>
But some guy said my aura's moonstone<br>
Just 'cause he was high<br>
And we're dancin' all night<br>
And you can try to change my mind<br>
But you might have to wait in line<br>
What's a girl gonna do?<br>
A diamond's gotta shine</p>

<p class="Para6">Best believe I'm still bejeweled<br>
When I walk in the room<br>
I can still make the whole place shimmer (shimmer)<br>
And when I meet the band<br>
They ask, "Do you have a man?"<br>
I can still say, "I don't remember"<br>
Familiarity breeds contempt<br>
Don't put me in the basement<br>
When I want the penthouse of your heart<br>
Diamonds in my eyes<br>
I polish up real (nice), I polish up real nice</p>

<p class="Para7">And we're dancin' all night<br>
And you can try to change my mind<br>
But you might have to wait in line<br>
What's a girl gonna do? What's a girl gonna do?<br>
I polish up nice<br>
Best believe I'm still bejeweled<br>
When I walk in the room<br>
I can still make the whole place shimmer </p>
